## 2nd IEEE ITSS Student Competition in Pedestrian Behavior Prediction

:bulb: Welcome to the official repository for the `2nd IEEE ITSS Student Competition in Pedestrian Behavior Prediction`! 

This competition focuses on Short-Term Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (ST-PTP) and Long-Term Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction (LT-PTP). PTP forecasts a pedestrian's future trajectory from a bird's-eye view, utilizing observed data from six surrounding cameras and lidar. The Short-Term Prediction (ST) targets a 3-second future path, while the Long-Term Prediction (LT) extends to 7 seconds.
