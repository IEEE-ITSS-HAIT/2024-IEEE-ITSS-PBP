# 2nd ITSS Student Competition in Pedestrian Behavior Prediction

Welcome to the official repository for the 2nd ITSS Student Competition in Pedestrian Behavior Prediction. This competition is organized by the IEEE ITSS Technical Committee on Human-Centered AI in Transportation (HAIT) and focuses on advancing AI technologies for predicting pedestrian behavior in the context of intelligent transportation systems.

## Competition Overview

**Goal:** Develop and test advanced AI algorithms capable of predicting pedestrian behaviors up to 6 seconds ahead, utilizing 3D trajectories and noisy sensor data, to enhance traffic safety and mobility efficiency in smart cities.

## How to Participate

1. **Register** on the competition platform, Codalab.
2. **Download the Dataset** from the provided links after registration.
3. **Submit Your Models** on the Codalab competition page by the deadline.

## Dataset Information

The competition dataset includes:
- Scene images
- LiDAR data
- Car localization raw inputs
Collected across five metropolitan areas in the USA, with additional datasets incorporating diverse social norms from various global locations.

## Evaluation Criteria

The models will be evaluated based on:
1. Accuracy of the 3D trajectory predictions.
2. Robustness to noisy inputs.
3. Efficiency of the computational algorithms.

## Orgnizer
